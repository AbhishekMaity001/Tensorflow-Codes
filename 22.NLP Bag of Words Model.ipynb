material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician hitchcock is a great director ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie it is this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films hence the whole story lacks a certain energy the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws mishima is extremely uninteresting this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture the flat reenactments do not hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films when i first watched this movie in the i loved it i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic the character developments also lacked in depth woa talk about awful do not waste your time it was just too horrible the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on but what really made it unwatchable was the direction the poor actors you can not even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action if you check the director s filmography on this site you will see why this film did nt have a chance this would not even be good as a made for tv flick if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care regrettably the film fails the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie yet i enjoy watching it unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad the dialogue sucked the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked the soundtrack sucked the acting sucked the concert sequences just sucked that was nice that was funny it was so funny overall this movie was cheap trash but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it i came out of it feeling angry spoilers whatever else can or can not be said about it surface is superbly crafted the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans and there was nt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here all things considered a job very well done thanks good a movie like this was done and released one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film up there with the best of melville everything about this film is simply incredible you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it is limitations it is an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that is because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series i am not sure what he was trying to do with this film if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded there is a lot of beautiful places it was forced like everything in this movie again lame here s where the movie really pied me off and do not even get me started on the jerky camerawork when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick summary the witticisms were nt witty the plot well i said i would let that one go the acting was bad really bad even billy bob could not rise above the script which was worse camerawork again bad rating out of an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time kieslowski never ceases to amaze me he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art three of the most visually appealing movies i have ever seen and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years i could not think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art out of for both the movie and trilogy i literally vomited while watching this film i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth s pearls his performance as awarded was stunning the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola s roeg wih a sublime cast i am translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled
